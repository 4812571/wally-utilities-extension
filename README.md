# Wally Utilities

This VSCode extension provides some nice-to-haves when using the [Wally](https://wally.run) package manager.

----

Features in `wally.toml`:

* **(TODO)** Validation for `package` info fields / settings.
* **(TODO)** The latest version of a package is displayed next to it in dependencies.
* Autocomplete for dependency package names and package versions.

----

Some additional features:

* Fully supports any number of fallback registries, in addition to the [public registry](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally-index).
* Adds the TOML language to the `wally.lock` file, giving it proper syntax highlighting.
