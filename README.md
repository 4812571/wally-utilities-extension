# Wally Utilities Extension

This extension provides some nice-to-haves when using the [Wally](https://wally.run) package manager.

In the `wally.toml` file:

* The latest version of a package is displayed next to it in dependencies.
* When adding a dependency, you get autocomplete for package names and package versions.

Some additional include:

* Adds the TOML language to the `wally.lock` file, giving it proper syntax highlighting.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something
